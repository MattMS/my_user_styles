# My user styles

[CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)
files I have created, for use with
[Stylish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylish),
to simplify sites I frequently visit.


## Getting started

Install Stylish in
[Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/)
or
[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe?hl=en).


## Selectors

Selectors are designed with increased specificity to ensure usage.
No need for `!important`.
